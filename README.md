# Comments
I found how to implement an ORM in vuex, to store the "login" and "task" data. I tried to implement it, but it was too late to add it to the login and to the to-do list, since it required making the project from 0.
It did not have a database to connect with the app. I had to bind the login with a REST app of a person, which is for patients and appointments.
